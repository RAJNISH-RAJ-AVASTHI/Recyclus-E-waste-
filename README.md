# Recyclus_E-waste
=>The project's aims to solve one of the most easily overlooked problem of
this day and age that is the problem of e-waste management.
=>As the waste keeps on growing and is expected to do so exponentially in
the future its better to intercept it before it gets too late.
=>'RECYCLUS' will connect the buyers of the e-waste, who are the people
with the recycling techniques to the sellers of the e-waste in a buyer seller
model.
=>Recyclus gives its users an opportunity to contribute to the environment
by choosing either the role of the seller or the buyer.
=>The three main objective behind developing the project are:
Lack of recycling techniques with everyone.
Improper knowledge about handling e-waste.
Lack of knowledge about recycling techniques.

To deal with this problem the best way seemed to connect the sellers of ewaste
to its buyers via Recyclus.

The following tools have been used for the development of the project:
#HTML5 #CSS3 #JAVASCRIPT #MYSQL #PHP #XAMPP #BOOTSTRAP v5.0
